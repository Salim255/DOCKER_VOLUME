##Volumes an Docker container

//Two type of External Data Storage:
    Volumes and Bind Mounts

\\\ There are two types of Volumes:
1)- Anonymous Volumes  2)- Named Volumes

In Both cases Docker set up a folder /path on your host machine,
 exact location is unknown to you (=dev).
 $Manged vi docker volume commands.$

        //// docker volume ls
* If we stoped the docker container the Anonymous valumes will disappear 


* Named Volumes : is a defined path in the container is mapped to the 
created volume/mount.
e.g/some-path on your hosting machine is mapped to /app/data

**We cant create name Volumes inside a docker file.
